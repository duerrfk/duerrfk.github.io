So you want to know more about the humble programmer and presenter of this blog? 

Besides being a humble programmer, I am a humble senior researcher and lecturer in computer science, mainly working on distributed systems, computer networks, and mobile systems, as well as an ethusiastic maker.

If you want to know a little bit more about my academic life, you might want to have a look at my notoriously outdated list of [publications](/publications/), or visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=H8vnsKQAAAAJ) for a more up-to-date view.

If you are a programmer yourself, you might want to visit my [Github page](https://github.com/duerrfk).

For anything not worth more than 280 characters, you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FrankDuerr).
