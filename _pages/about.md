So you want to know more about the humble programmer and author of this blog?

Besides being a humble programmer, I am a humble senior researcher and lecturer in computer science at the Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems at University of Stuttgart, Germany. My main research interests are distributed systems, computer networks (e.g., time-sensitive networking (TSN), software-defined networking (SDN)), and mobile systems. Moreover, I am an enthusiastic maker.

If you want to know a little bit more about my academic life, you might want to have a look at my notoriously outdated list of [publications](/publications/), or visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=H8vnsKQAAAAJ) for a more up-to-date view.

If you are a programmer yourself, you might want to visit my [Github page](https://github.com/duerrfk).

For anything not worth more than 280 characters, you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FrankDuerr).
