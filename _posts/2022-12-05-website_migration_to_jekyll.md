As you might have noticed, my humble blog now looks a little bit different, and you might miss some older posts, at least in the unlikely case that you knew my old website. 

I have migrated from Wordpress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) -- something I should have done already a long time ago. Jekyll is a much better fit for a humble programmer's website: very efficient ("lean and mean") and compatible with technologies and tools that every programmer likes and knows such as Markdown and Git.

The migration is still in progress. Old posts will reappear bit by bit over time.
